# Assembly-RPN-Calculator

This project was intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi and is currently limited to addition, multiplication, and multiplcation. Division and clear stack commands are soon to come.

When using, ensure that your version of ARM Assembly has access to the C library as well as the MUL command.
